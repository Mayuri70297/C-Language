        <h1>Basic Structure of C Program</h1><br>
        <p>Structure of C Program is defined by set of rules called protocol, to be followed by programmer while writing
            C program. All C program are having sections/parts which are mentioned below -
            <div class="list1">
            <li>Documentation section</li>
            <li>Link section</li>
            <li>Definition section</li>
            <li>Global declaration section</li>
            <li>Functio prototype declaration section</li>
            <li>Main function</li>
            <li>User defined function definition section</li>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Many programming language such as java, C++, Pascal, COBOL etc., have a certain standard format which should
            be followed of the programmer. In the same way, the C language also has the standard structure which resembles
            this. 
        </p>
        <div>
            <div class="program">
                <p>#include&lt;Header Files&gt<br>[Global Declaration]<br>main()<br>{<br>&lt;Local Declaration&gt ;
               <br>&lt;Statements&gt ;<br>}</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>In the syntax, we mentioned include header files, which means we have to include the header file in the
                    second line, you can see global declarations. It indicates that a function or the variable an be declared
                    here and accessed anywhere in the program.</li>
                <li>The main function, this is neccessary in each C program, because the execution starts in main function.</li>
                <li>Each C Program must be started with the main function.</li>
                <li>Following main function, we used the curly braces which are parts to start and of closing of the program.</li>
                <li>The statements are nothing but, the goal of the function.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3>Understanding Header Files</h3>
        <p>We need to declare all functions in C language before you can use them. Because it would be helpful to group
        related function declaration and manage them in a single place. This is the function of header files.<br>
        Header files are vital in large projects because they give you an overview of source code without having to look
        through every line of code.<br>The header files are the collection of pre defined functions neccessary for the
        operation of a prgram if it in a section written by the user of code, or as an element of the standard libraries of C
        language by conventio, the names of the header files finish with .h(dot h).<br>The suffix of .h is used by header files
        which are equipped with operating system. We can also make our own header files if we need.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>The header files define the Following functions :</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Structures of certain files and subroutines.</li>
        <li>Type the synonyms or implementation chaeacteristics.</li>
        <li>Constants and macros which are substituted during the phase of pretreatment of language C.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>Header Files</h4>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><i>string.h</i> - This file contains the functios which are related to string manupulations.</li>
                <li><i>alloc.h</i> - It has the function which are related with memory allocation.</li>
                <li><i>time.h</i> - This header file consists of the time related functions.</li>
                <li><i>conio.h</i> - The con io.h has console (i.e. monitor) input output functions.</li>
                <li><i>ctype.h</i> - It include the functions which are related to conversion.</li>
                <li><i>stdlib.h</i> - It has standard library functions and also memory allocation.</li>
                <li><i>graphics.h</i> - It has many built in functions that support graphics.</li>
                <li><i>dos.h</i> - It defines many functions that are related to date and delay which is used to set interval.</li>
                <li><i>process.h</i> - It contains system supporting functions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Main Function</h3>
        <p>A C program composed of one or more functions.<br>A functions is a line of one or more statements which are joined
         in curly brackets carry our a certain operations and return a simple value to the program in which they reside; it also
         could be look like subroutine.<br>All the C program must have main function. The execution of program start with main 
         function.<br>This mai function will call usually other functions coming from same program, and other of the libraries to
         carry out its work.<br>Mainly function has two parts : <ul  class="list" style="list-style: decimal"><li><i>Declaratory Part</i> :It handles
         declaration of the variables.<li><i>Achievable Part</i> : It contain the code which carries out of detail charge.</li>
         </li></ul></p>
         <hr>
         <h3>First C Program</h3>
         <div>
             <div class="program">
                 <p>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt<br>#include&lt;conio.h&gt<br>void main()<br>{<br>clrscr();<br>printf("Hello World");
                <br>getch();<br>}</p>
             </div>    
             <ul class="list">
                <li><i>Printing a Text message</i><br><p>It is a comment line which denotes the purpose of the program.</p></li>
                <li><i>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt</i><br><p>It is a preprocessor directive which is used to include stdio.h which
                    contains standard input and output functions.</p></li>
                <li><i>void main()</i><br><p>'main' is a function, every programs execution start from the main function which should
                    be enclosed with the pair of curly braces. A void is a keyword which indicates the main function should 
                    not return any value.</p></li>
                <li><i>printf("HelloWorld");</i><br><p>printf() is a function which is used to print the given information inside the brackets.</p></li>
             </ul>
